# 🧠 Diabetic Rehospitalization Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts whether a diabetic patient will be readmitted to the hospital within 30 days using structured hospital data. Built with logistic regression, Random Forest, MLP, and SVM classifiers.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

To build a reliable classification model that predicts early readmissions (<30 days) for diabetic patients, helping healthcare providers prioritize high-risk cases and reduce hospital costs.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: [UCI ML Repository – Diabetes 130-US hospitals](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/296/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008)
- **Rows**: ~100,000+ encounters
- **Target**: `readmitted` (transformed to binary: 1 for `<30`, 0 for `NO` and `>30`)
⚖️ **Note**: The dataset was **downsampled** to reduce class imbalance, ensuring a more balanced and realistic training set (approximately 1:2 ratio for readmitted vs not).

## 🔧 Key Features & Engineering

- 🧪 **Diagnosis Mapping**: Combined `diag_1`, `diag_2`, `diag_3` into broad ICD-9 categories (e.g., Circulatory, Diabetes)
- 💊 **Drug Score**: Aggregated all drug-related features into a single `drug_score`
- 🏥 **Inpatient Ratio**: Ratio of inpatient visits over total visits
- ⏱ **Age Buckets to Numeric**: Converted `[30-40)` to `35`, etc.
- 🚦 **Total Interventions**: Sum of procedures, medications, lab tests
